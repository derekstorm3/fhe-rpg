## Overview

FHE-RPG is a groundbreaking application that demonstrates the power of Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) in blockchain gaming. By leveraging Zama's fhEVM technology, this project creates a quiz game where all sensitive data—including player answers, correctness verification, and score calculations—are processed entirely in encrypted form on-chain.

This approach solves a fundamental problem in blockchain applications: the transparency of blockchain data makes it impossible to create truly private gaming experiences with traditional smart contracts. With FHE, we can now have both the security and decentralization of blockchain while maintaining complete privacy for user data.

### Data Flow

1. **Question Loading**: Frontend fetches public question data (prompts, options, rewards)
2. **Answer Encryption**: Player selects answer → Zama SDK encrypts client-side
3. **Submission**: Encrypted answer + proof sent to smart contract
4. **On-Chain Verification**: Contract compares encrypted answer with encrypted correct answer using FHE.eq()
5. **Score Update**: If correct, encrypted reward added to encrypted score using FHE.add()
6. **Decryption Request**: Player wallet signs EIP-712 decryption request
7. **Private Decryption**: Zama relayer network decrypts with user's private key
8. **Display**: Decrypted score and results shown only to the player

## Problem Statement

### Traditional Blockchain Gaming Challenges

**1. Privacy Paradox**
- Blockchain's transparency is a core feature for trust and verification
- However, this same transparency prevents private gaming experiences
- All state changes are publicly visible, making cheating trivial in quiz/trivia games
- Players can view correct answers before submitting their own

**2. Off-Chain Solutions Are Inadequate**
- Moving computation off-chain sacrifices decentralization
- Introduces trusted third parties and single points of failure
- Creates verification challenges (how do you prove off-chain computation was honest?)
- Vulnerable to server hacks and data breaches

**3. Commitment Schemes Are Limited**
- Require multiple transactions (commit → reveal flow)
- Increase gas costs and complexity
- Reveal phase can still expose information
- Not suitable for real-time gaming experiences

**4. Zero-Knowledge Proofs Are Complex**
- Require specialized circuit design for each game mechanic
- High computational overhead for proof generation
- Limited to proving specific properties, not general computation
- Steep learning curve for developers

### How FHE Solves These Problems

**Fully Homomorphic Encryption** enables computation on encrypted data without decryption:

1. **True On-Chain Privacy**: All sensitive data remains encrypted throughout the entire lifecycle
2. **Verifiable Computation**: Smart contract logic executes on encrypted values with cryptographic guarantees
3. **No Trust Required**: Eliminates need for trusted third parties or off-chain computation
4. **Simple Developer Experience**: Write Solidity code as usual, with encrypted types (euint, ebool)
5. **User Control**: Only the user can decrypt their own data using their wallet's private key

## How It Works

### Game Mechanics

1. **Quiz Structure**
   - Fantasy RPG-themed questions with narrative elements
   - Binary choice questions (2 options per question)
   - Each question has an associated reward (points)
   - Questions can only be answered once per player

2. **Answer Submission Process**
   ```
   Player → Select Answer (Client)
           ↓
   Zama SDK → Encrypt Answer with FHE (Client-side)
           ↓
   Web3 Wallet → Sign and Submit Transaction
           ↓
   Smart Contract → Compare Encrypted Answer with Encrypted Correct Answer
           ↓
   FHE Operations → Calculate New Score (if correct: score + reward, else: score)
           ↓
   Blockchain → Store Encrypted Score, Encrypted Result
   ```

3. **Score and Result Decryption**
   ```
   Player → Request Decryption (Client)
           ↓
   Zama SDK → Generate Keypair + Create EIP-712 Request
           ↓
   Web3 Wallet → Sign Decryption Request
           ↓
   Zama Relayer → Process Request with User's Key
           ↓
   Client → Receive and Display Decrypted Values
   ```

### FHE Operations Used

#### Core Operations

- **FHE.asEuint32(value)**: Convert plaintext integer to encrypted integer
- **FHE.fromExternal(handle, proof)**: Import encrypted value from client
- **FHE.eq(a, b)**: Compare two encrypted values for equality (returns ebool)
- **FHE.add(a, b)**: Add two encrypted integers (returns euint32)
- **FHE.select(condition, ifTrue, ifFalse)**: Conditional selection with encrypted condition

#### Permission System

- **FHE.allowThis(value)**: Grant contract permission to use encrypted value
- **FHE.allow(value, address)**: Grant specific address permission to decrypt value
- **FHE.isInitialized(value)**: Check if encrypted value has been initialized

### Example Flow

**Player Alice answers Question 0:**

```solidity
// 1. Alice encrypts her answer (option 0) client-side
uint32 aliceAnswer = 0;
EncryptedInput input = zamaInstance.createEncryptedInput(quizAddress, aliceAddress);
input.add32(aliceAnswer);
Encrypted encrypted = await input.encrypt();

// 2. Contract receives encrypted answer
euint32 encryptedAnswer = FHE.fromExternal(answerHandle, inputProof);
euint32 correctAnswer = _correctAnswers[0]; // Already encrypted: euint32(0)

// 3. Compare in encrypted form
ebool isCorrect = FHE.eq(encryptedAnswer, correctAnswer); // Returns encrypted "true"

// 4. Calculate new score using encrypted condition
euint32 reward = _rewards[0]; // Encrypted: euint32(50)
euint32 currentScore = _scores[alice]; // Encrypted: euint32(0)
euint32 incrementedScore = FHE.add(currentScore, reward); // Encrypted: euint32(50)
euint32 newScore = FHE.select(isCorrect, incrementedScore, currentScore); // Returns incrementedScore

// 5. Store encrypted values
_scores[alice] = newScore; // Stores encrypted 50
_answerResults[alice][0] = isCorrect; // Stores encrypted true

// Note: At no point was any value decrypted on-chain!
```

## Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run with gas reporting
REPORT_GAS=true npm test

# Run coverage analysis
npm run coverage
```

### Test Suite

Located at: `/test/EncryptedQuiz.ts`

**Test Coverage:**

1. **Initial State Tests**
   - Verifies uninitialized player has zero score
   - Confirms no questions are marked as answered initially

2. **Correct Answer Tests**
   - Encrypts and submits correct answer
   - Verifies encrypted score increases by reward amount
   - Checks encrypted result decrypts to `true`
   - Confirms question is marked as answered

3. **Incorrect Answer Tests**
   - Submits correct answer for Q0, incorrect for Q1
   - Verifies score doesn't increase for wrong answer
   - Checks encrypted result decrypts to `false`

4. **Duplicate Prevention Tests**
   - Attempts to answer the same question twice
   - Verifies transaction reverts with "Question already answered"

### Test Architecture

```typescript
// Uses Hardhat's fhEVM mock provider
if (!fhevm.isMock) {
  console.warn("EncryptedQuiz tests require the FHEVM mock provider");
  this.skip();
}

// Encrypt value for testing
const encryptedOption = await fhevm
  .createEncryptedInput(quizAddress, signers.alice.address)
  .add32(0)
  .encrypt();

// Decrypt result for assertion
const clearScore = await fhevm.userDecryptEuint(
  FhevmType.euint32,
  encryptedScore,
  quizAddress,
  signers.alice
);

expect(clearScore).to.eq(50);
```

### Mock Provider

The fhEVM mock provider simulates FHE operations locally:
- No actual encryption in test environment
- Fast execution for rapid development
- Enables standard Chai assertions on "encrypted" values

## Deployment

### Deployment Script

Located at: `/deploy/deploy.ts`

Uses Hardhat Deploy for deterministic deployments:

```typescript
const deployedQuiz = await deploy("EncryptedGameQuiz", {
  from: deployer,
  log: true,
});
```

### Deployment Process

#### Local Deployment

```bash
# 1. Start local node
npm run chain

# 2. In another terminal, deploy
npm run deploy:localhost
```

#### Sepolia Deployment

```bash
# Ensure .env is configured with:
# - PRIVATE_KEY (funded with Sepolia ETH)
# - INFURA_API_KEY
# - ETHERSCAN_API_KEY (optional, for verification)

npm run deploy:sepolia
```

### Post-Deployment Steps

1. **Save Contract Address**
   - Deployment logs will show: `EncryptedQuiz contract: 0x...`
   - Copy this address

2. **Update Frontend Configuration**
   - Edit `ui/src/config/contracts.ts`
   - Set `QUIZ_ADDRESS` to your deployed contract address

3. **Verify on Etherscan** (Optional but recommended)
   ```bash
   npm run verify:sepolia
   ```

4. **Test the Deployment**
   - Visit your frontend
   - Connect wallet
   - Try answering questions
   - Verify transactions on Etherscan

### Deployment Configuration

Networks are configured in `hardhat.config.ts`:

```typescript
networks: {
  sepolia: {
    accounts: PRIVATE_KEY ? [PRIVATE_KEY] : [],
    chainId: 11155111,
    url: `https://sepolia.infura.io/v3/${INFURA_API_KEY}`,
  },
}
```

## Security Considerations

### Smart Contract Security

1. **Reentrancy Protection**
   - No external calls before state updates
   - Follow checks-effects-interactions pattern

2. **Access Control**
   - `submitAnswer` validates `msg.sender` implicitly
   - Scores and results are tied to wallet addresses

3. **Input Validation**
   - Question ID bounds checking
   - Duplicate submission prevention
   - Proof validation through fhEVM library

4. **Encrypted Data Permissions**
   - Explicit permission grants: `FHE.allowThis()`, `FHE.allow()`
   - Only player can decrypt their own score/results

### Frontend Security

1. **Private Key Management**
   - Never expose private keys in frontend code
   - Use hardware wallets for significant funds
   - Environment variables for development only

2. **Input Sanitization**
   - Validate question IDs before submission
   - Check wallet connection state
   - Handle encryption errors gracefully

3. **Signature Security**
   - EIP-712 typed signatures for decryption requests
   - 7-day validity window for decryption permissions
   - User must explicitly approve each signature

### FHE-Specific Security

1. **Decryption Security**
   - Decryption happens via Zama relayer network
   - User's signature required for decryption
   - Only user can decrypt their own data

2. **Proof Requirements**
   - Encrypted inputs must include validity proofs
   - Prevents submission of invalid encrypted data

3. **Privacy Guarantees**
   - Correct answers never exposed on-chain
   - Player answers remain encrypted
   - Scores only decryptable by owner

### Best Practices

1. **Always use testnet first** (Sepolia) before mainnet
2. **Audit smart contracts** before production deployment
3. **Monitor gas costs** - FHE operations are expensive
4. **Keep dependencies updated** - Regular `npm audit` and updates
5. **Test thoroughly** - Run full test suite before deployment
6. **Use hardware wallets** for deployment keys
7. **Verify contracts** on Etherscan for transparency

### Known Limitations

1. **Gas Costs**: FHE operations consume significantly more gas than traditional operations
2. **Decryption Latency**: Decryption requests require time (typically 10-30 seconds)
3. **Network Dependency**: Relies on Zama relayer network availability
4. **Browser Compatibility**: Requires modern browsers with WebAssembly support
